## About Me

Junior Developer with a love for building CLI tools in Go. I appreciate Go for its robust standard library and the productivity it brings to my workflow. While I occasionally dabble in Python for quick and dirty scripts, I prefer to steer clear of it for larger projects. And when it comes to Front End, well, let's just say it's not my cup of tea. ðŸ˜‰
